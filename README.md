# AutoMD
Fast to molecular dynamics simulation. 

Installtion
==== 
### 1. Install the Desmond package.  

Firstly, download the academic edition of [Desmond package](https://www.deshawresearch.com/resources.html) and install it on you HPC or PC. Of course, you can install the [SCHRODINGER package](https://www.schrodinger.com/downloads/releases) instead the academic edition of Desmond. Then, set the environment variable `$Desmond` to the installtion path of Desmond.  e.g. ```export Desmond=/public/home/wanglin3/software/DS21```.   

You can change the path to the installtion path of Desmond or SCHRODINGER, and run this command:  
```
echo "export Desmond=${PWD}/" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Install the viparr and msys by pip.  

Firstly, download the msys and viparr.   
```
wget https://github.com/DEShawResearch/viparr/releases/download/4.7.35/viparr-4.7.35-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
wget https://github.com/DEShawResearch/msys/releases/download/1.7.337/msys-1.7.337-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```
Secondly, run these commands to create a new virtual environment for viparr.
```
${Desmond}/run schrodinger_virtualenv.py schrodinger.ve
source schrodinger.ve/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```
Then, install the msys and viparr by SchrÃ¶dinger pip.
```
pip install msys-1.7.337-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
pip install viparr-4.7.35-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
echo "export viparr=${PWD}/schrodinger.ve/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Download the force field library for Viparr.  

Then, clone the public Viparr parameters from D.E. Shaw Research's GitHub repository, and set the environment variable. 
```
git clone git://github.com/DEShawResearch/viparr-ffpublic.git
echo "export VIPARR_FFPATH=${PWD}/viparr-ffpublic/ff" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 4. Download AutoMD and set environment variable.

```
git clone https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/AutoMD
cd AutoMD
echo "alias AutoMD=${PWD}/AutoMD" >> ~/.bashrc
chmod +x AutoMD
source ~/.bashrc
```
Copy the mreged Amber force field to `${VIPARR_FFPATH}`.
```
cp -r ff/* ${VIPARR_FFPATH}/
```

Usage
====
__Options:__  
```
Input parameter:  
  -i    Use a file name (Multiple files are wrapped in "", and split by ' ') "*.mae" or "*.cms" ;  
            or regular expression to represent your input file, default is *.mae.  

System Builder parameter:  
  -S    System Build Mode: <INC>  
        INC: System in cell, salt buffer is 0.15M KCl, water is SPC. Add K to neutralize system.  
        OUC: System out of cell, salt buffer is 0.15M NaCl, water is SPC. Add Na to neutralize system.    
        Custom Instruct: Such as: "TIP4P:Cl:0.15-Na-Cl+0.02-Fe2-Cl+0.02-Mg2-Cl"    
            Interactive addition of salt. Add Cl to neutralize system.  
                for positive_ion: Na, Li, K, Rb, Cs, Fe2, Fe3, Mg2, Ca2, Zn2 are predefined.  
                for nagative_ion: F, Cl, Br, I are predefined.  
                for water: SPC, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP5P, DMSO, METHANOL are predefined.  
  -l    Lipid type for membrane box. Use this option will build membrane box. <None>  
            Lipid types: POPC, POPE, DPPC, DMPC.  
  -b    Define a boxshape for your systems. <cubic>  
            box types: dodecahedron_hexagon, cubic, orthorhombic, triclinic  
  -s    Define a boxsize for your systems.  <15.0>  
            for dodecahedron_hexagon and cubic, defulat is 15.0;  
            for orthorhombic or triclinic box, defulat is [15.0 15.0 15.0];  
            If you want use Orthorhombic or Triclinic box, your parameter should be like "15.0 15.0 15.0"  
  -R    Redistribute the mass of heavy atoms to bonded hydrogen atoms to slow-down high frequency motions.  
  -F    Define a force field to build your systems. <OPLS_2005>  
            OPLS_2005, S-OPLS are recommended to receptor-ligand systems.  
            Amber, Charmm, DES-Amber are recommended to other systems. Use -O to show more details.  
            Use the "Custom" to load parameters from input .cms file.  

Simulation control parameter:  
  -m    Enter the maximum simulation time for the Brownian motion simulation, in ps. <100>  
  -r    The relaxation protocol before MD, "Membrane" or "Solute". <Solute>  
  -e    The ensemble class in MD stage, "NPT", "NVT", "NPgT". <NPT>  
  -t    Enter the Molecular dynamics simulation time for the product simulation, in ns. <100>  
  -T    Specify the temperature to be used, in kelvin. <310>  
  -N    Number of Repeat simulation with different random numbers. <1>  
  -P    Define a ASL to receptor, such as "protein".  
  -L    Define a ASL to ligand and run interaction analysis, such as "res.ptype UNK".  
  -u    Turn off md simulation, only system build.  
  -C    Set constraint to an ASL, such as "chain.name A AND backbone"  
  -f    Set constraint force, default is 10.  
  -o    Specify the approximate number of frames in the trajectory.  <1000>  
        This value is coupled with the recording interval for the trajectory and the simulation time:  
        the number of frames times the trajectory recording interval is the total simulation time.  
        If you adjust the number of frames, the recording interval will be modified.  
```
__Example:__   
```
1) MD for cytoplasmic protein-ligand complex:  
AutoMD -i "*.mae" -S INC -P "chain.name A" -L "res.ptype UNK" -F "OPLS_2005"  
2) MD for plasma protein-protein complex:  
AutoMD -i "*.mae" -S OUC -F "DES-Amber"  
3) MD for DNA/RNA-protein complex:  
AutoMD -i "*.mae" -S "SPC:Cl:0.15-K-Cl+0.02-Mg2-Cl" -F Amber  
4) MD for membrane protein, need to prior place membrane in Meastro.  
AutoMD -i "*.mae" -S OUC -l "POPC" -r "Membrane" -F "Charmm"
