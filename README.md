```
echo "export Desmond=${PWD}/" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Firstly, download the msys and viparr.   
```
wget https://github.com/DEShawResearch/viparr/releases/download/4.7.35/viparr-4.7.35-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
wget https://github.com/DEShawResearch/msys/releases/download/1.7.337/msys-1.7.337-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```
Secondly, run these commands to create a new virtual environment for viparr.

echo "export viparr=${PWD}/schrodinger.ve/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Download the force field library for Viparr.  

Then, clone the public Viparr parameters from D.E. Shaw Research's GitHub repository, and set the environment variable. 
```
git clone git://github.com/DEShawResearch/viparr-ffpublic.git
echo "export VIPARR_FFPATH=${PWD}/viparr-ffpublic/ff" >> ~/.bashrc
